    "Using Python and the skills we learned over the past week, create a shopping cart program that will allow a user to add and remove items to a shopping cart. The cart should keep track of the quantity and price of each item.  The user should also be able to view the items that are currently in their cart. The user should be able to continue to add to, remove from, and view their cart until the user \"quits\" or \"checks out\". When the user quits/checks out, the program should display a receipt showing the items in the cart with quantity and price and the total price."
